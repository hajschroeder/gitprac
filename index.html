      The intent of this page is for me to work on my 
      coding skills as they develop. I will likely add to this as I go and learn.

    <h3> I have a lot of work to do!!! </h3>

    <p>
    Before I started this new chapter in my life, there
    were several changes I needed to make
    </p>

    <p> These were the things I needed to do. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Admit that I was not happy at my previous job</li>
      <li>Determine if a coding program would be right for me</li>
      <li>Choose the right coding program</li>
      <li>Seek new employment</li>
      <li>Quit smoking cigarettes (in progress)</li>
      </ol>


      <p>As I add more to this one of the things I'd like to do
        is add more resources that I hope some people find helpful.

        <ul> Helpful Resources here
