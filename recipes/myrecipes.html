  <h1>Here's Some of My Recipes!</h1>
  <h2>Simple, yet delicious</h2>

  <p class="intro">Are you on a budget? Maybe you're a little short on time these days. 

    Perhaps you've been wanting to start cooking meals for yourself and your loved ones
    but feel you lack the skills and confidence to work your magic in the kitchen.
  </p>

  <p class= "intent">Well worry not, my friend. I've got you covered. This page of my practice site
    is designed to provide you with some instructions and pointers of how to make the most
    of your kitchen.
  </p>
  
  <div class= "important">
  <p class= "goal">It should be noted, very little of what I intend to share here needs to be followed to a T.
    My feelings towards cooking is that you should make food the way you like it. The recipe wants 
    4 cloves of garlic, but you really like garlic? Make it 8! They want you to use ground beef, but you dont
    eat red meat? Go ahead and use turkey.  
  </p>
  </div>
  <p class= "examp">Finally, the last thing I care about is instructing you on how to make a single meal. '
    Rather, my goal is to share with you various skils and techniques I've learned
    over my years of being a home cook that simplify the process. For example, its 
    much easier to read "make a roux" and understand what to do rather than read a recipe that says
      <ol>Make a roux by
        <li>Bringing a small saucepan to medium low heat.</li>
        <li>In the saucepan combine
          <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of flour</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Whisk together until the flour and butter form a paste</li>
        <p>Note: do not let the flour burn. Mind the tempature of your pan</p>
      </ol>

      Obviously, it is easier to know how to do something than it is to re-read the steps each time.
